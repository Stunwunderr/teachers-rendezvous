                        <p>During the last 52nd convocation ceremony on campus, hearing and seeing students that came out in flying colors in their respective department and faculty including having to be the best graduating student in Unilag will make you have the urge and willingness to also attain such height or even higher ones but it takes a lot of discipline and determination. One thing is to desire something another is to get the job done.  </p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/black-guy-student.jpg" alt="Best graduating student Unilag"></a>
                        <p>For this reason we carefully examined what could be an hindrance to becoming a great student and came out with this 9 sure ways to be who you want to be as a student</p>
                        <p>They include;</p>
                        <p><i>Have a purpose</i></p>
                        <p><i>Be a Goal Getter</i></p>
                        <p><i>Be with like minded People</i></p>
                        <p><i>Socialise More</i></p>
                        <p><i>Ask yourself Questions</i></p>
                        <p><i>Eat Nutritious Foods</i></p>
                        <p><i>Get into a Beneficial Relationships</i></p>
                        <p><i>Be ready for Challenges</i></p>
                        <p><i>Dress smartly</i></p>
                        <h3>Have a Purpose</h3>
                        <p>When you have a purpose in life there are greater chances of you achieving your goal with less effort and a lesser time. What do you want to be in life? Do you just merely want to get by in life? or you want to solve real life problems with the course you study these questions makes you want to be more interested in your Discipline and automatically makes you want to know more and make more research.</p>
                        <h3>Be a Goal Getter</h3>
                        <p>To be successful student you have to learn to do away with Procrastination. It is always easy to say i am going to study at a particular time or attend that seminar or go for registration of that programme that will add value to your study and even life but very hard to get it done in actuality. Always go for Goals, instead of just procrastinating just get it done for no time is the right time.</p>
                        <h3>Be with Like-Minded People</h3>
                        <p>You cannot want to be Chemical Engineer then make friends and associate from falculty of law it just two different career path in life. Choose your friends, associate and most importantly role models wisely. These people are the ones that could actually find solutions to the numerous problem and question you have because they are successful and not just successful but experience in your field of study.</p>
                        <h3>Socialise More</h3>
                        <p>This does not mean you should go for all parties and gatherings on and off campus. What am saying is that is for you to become more open to meet new people afterall it is the people you know now that are your potential 'connections' in the future. Do not just focus on Academics be free to explore other part of life but know when not to make excesses of it.</p>
                        <h3>Ask Yourself Questions</h3>
                        <p>do you once a while ask yourself some fundamental questionabout who you are and the person you aspire to be, if you have not started asking yourself these questions you should start now because this will make you refocus and channel ypur energy to the right cause. I suggest you do this every morning when you wake up which helps you to focus for each day.</p>
                        <h3>Eat Nutritios Foods</h3>
                        <p>This could be a bit challenging especially for those of us that are not that financially buoyant but it still does not mean you should eat all the rubbish that comes your wayall in the name of sapa (term used to describe brokeness). It is scientifically proven that when you eat Nutritiousfoods and balance diet it helps the brain to become active and open to learning which makes you learn at ease.</p>
                        <h3>Get into a Beneficial Relationships</h3>
                        <p>Personally i won't advise you to get emotionally attached to anyone, study needs all of you it most times difficult to be able to combine all that together but if you must be in a relationship i beg you, let it be a mutual one. the person must be able to understand your goals and help you achieve it.</p>
                        <h3>Be Ready for Challenges</h3>
                        <p>Challenges are what makes you become who you want, you can't talk about having first class if you are not ready to go extra mile. What lecturers do most time is to give a summary of the topic they expect you to make your own personal study and research which could become challenging. Make challenges fun for you that is all am saying to get throughit.</p>
                        <h3>Dress Smartly</h3>
                        <p>All i can say is dress the way you want to be addressed. What is the image you want people to see through you. Anyone meeting you for the first time know little or nothing about you so it your appearance that gives out the first thoughtabout who you are.</p>
